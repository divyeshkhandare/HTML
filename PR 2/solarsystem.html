    <h3>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest
        of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury,
        Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar
        System developed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a
        protoplanetary disc.

    <h2 id="1">1. Marcury</h2>
    <img src="./image/Mercury.webp" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the
        Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is
        classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is
        heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its
        largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet
        (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system
        generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="2">2. Venus</h2>
    <img src="./image/Venus.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its
        orbital neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed
        mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean
        temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These conditions
        are extreme enough to compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state close to Venus's surface.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="3">3. Earth</h2>
    <img src="./image/Earth.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by
        Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of
        Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's
        crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
        Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar
        deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust
        consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
        earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the
        destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="4">4. Mars</h2>
    <img src="./image/MARS.png" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III)
        oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky
        and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a
        terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212
        mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is
        equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in
        shape: Phobos and Deimos.</p>

    <h2 id="5">5. Juoiter</h2>
    <img src="./image/jupiter.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
        than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one
        one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital
        period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and
        Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient
        Roman religion.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="6">6. Saturn</h2>
    <img src="./image/saturn.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250">
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
        giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.[26][27] It has only one-eighth the
        average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[28][29][30] Even though Saturn is nearly the size
        of Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU
        (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 years.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="7">7. Uranus</h2>
    <img src="./image/Uranus.png" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of
        water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles.
        The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K
        (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde
        rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun,
        its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="8">8. Naptune</h2>
    <img src="./image/Naptune.png" alt="" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System
        by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and
        slightly more massive than fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because
        its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and
        liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital
        distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god
        of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.</p>
