    <h3>The Ganges River (/ˈɡændʒiːz/ GAN-jeez; in India: Ganga, /ˈɡʌŋɡɑː/ GUNG-ah; in Bangladesh: Padma, /ˈpʌdmə/
        PUD-mə) is a trans-boundary river of Asia which flows through India and Bangladesh. The 2,525 km
        (1,569 mi) river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It flows south and east
        through the Gangetic plain of North India, receiving the right-bank tributary, the Yamuna, which also rises
        in the western Indian Himalayas, and several left-bank tributaries from Nepal that account for the bulk of
        its flow. In West Bengal state, India, a feeder canal taking off from its right bank diverts 50% of
        its flow southwards, artificially connecting it to the Hooghly River. The Ganges continues into Bangladesh,
        its name changing to the Padma. It is then joined by the Jamuna, the lower stream of the Brahmaputra, and
        eventually the Meghna, forming the major estuary of the Ganges Delta, and emptying into the Bay of Bengal.
        The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna system is the second-largest river on earth by discharge.</h3>

    <h3>The main stem of the Ganges begins at the town of Devprayag,[1] at the confluence of the Alaknanda, which is the
        source stream in hydrology on account of its greater length, and the Bhagirathi, which is considered the source
        stream in all of Hindu mythology.</h3>
